<!-- Tallies  -->

<!--In cases where the user needs to specify many different tallies each of which-->
<!--are spatially separate, the following tag can be used to cut down on some of the tally-->
<!--overhead. The effect of assuming all tallies are spatially separate is that once-->
<!--one tally is scored to, the same event is assumed not to score to any other-->
<!--tallies. This can lead to incorrect results if used improperly.  It does not-->
<!--apply for this geometry and these tallies, so we leave it commented out.-->

<!--Available Filters-->
<!--cell:       A list of cells in which the tally should be accumulated.-->
<!--cellborn:   This filter allows the tally to be scored to only when particles were originally born in a specified cell.-->
<!--surface:    A list of surfaces for which the tally should be accumulated.-->
<!--material:   A list of materials for which the tally should be accumulated.-->
<!--universe:   A list of universes for which the tally should be accumulated.-->
<!--energy:     A monotonically increasing list of bounding pre-collision energies for a number of groups. For example, if this filter is specified as <energy>0.0 1.0 20.0</energy>, then two energy bins will be created, one with energies between 0 and 1 MeV and the other with energies between 1 and 20 MeV.-->
<!--energyout:  A monotonically increasing list of bounding post-collision energies for a number of groups. For example, if this filter is specified as <energyout>0.0 1.0 20.0</energyout>, then two post-collision energy bins will be created, one with energies between 0 and 1 MeV and the other with energies between 1 and 20 MeV.-->
<!--mesh:       The id of a structured mesh to be tallied over.-->

<!--Available Scores-->
<!--flux:           Total flux-->
<!--total:          Total reaction rate-->
<!--scatter:        Total scattering rate. Can also be identified with the scatter-0 response type.-->
<!--nu-scatter:     Total production of neutrons due to scattering. This accounts for multiplicity from (n,2n), (n,3n), and (n,4n) reactions and should be slightly higher than the scattering rate.-->
<!--scatter-N:      Tally the Nth scattering moment, where N is the Legendre expansion order. N must be between 0 and 10. As an example, tallying the 2nd scattering moment would be specified as <scores> scatter-2 </scores>.-->
<!--scatter-PN:     Tally all of the scattering moments from order 0 to N, where N is the Legendre expansion order. That is, scatter-P1 is equivalent to requesting tallies of scatter-0 and scatter-1. N must be between 0 and 10. As an example, tallying up to the 2nd scattering moment would be specified as <scores> scatter-P2 </scores>.-->
<!--absorption:     Total absorption rate. This accounts for all reactions which do not produce secondary neutrons.-->
<!--fission:        Total fission rate-->
<!--nu-fission:     Total production of neutrons due to fission-->
<!--kappa-fission:  The recoverable energy production rate due to fission. The recoverable energy is defined as the fission product kinetic energy, prompt and delayed neutron kinetic energies, prompt and delayed -ray total energies, and the total energy released by the delayed  particles. The neutrino energy does not contribute to this response. The prompt and delayed -rays are assumed to deposit their energy locally.-->
<!--events:         Number of scoring events-->
